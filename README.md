Landing Page

This project is a mock landing page for a potential consulting business. It is a very simple, yet professional layout using only HTML, CSS, and flexbox properties.

I grew comfortable with using div elements at the end of my project. I took time learning what I want the flex items to do and getting my code to do so. I was challenged with the width and height properties for my images, and spent a fair share of my time researching those topics as well.
